# Sensor Gateway
This project aims to use an Arduino Nano pro to collect sensor data from 433Mhz, and forward them on a BlueTooth UART.
The implementation uses the QM editor and the qpn-avr framework, which allow to develop software using Harel state machines.
A state machine here is dedicated for a non block led blink feature.
